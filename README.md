### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Hi I'm Arda
#### Who am Ä±
Hello, I am Ahmet Arda Ä°zci. I am a third-year student at Harran University, with a keen interest in Java /Kotlin. My passion for the internet world has led me towards becoming a software developer, and I am writing this text to introduce myself.

I took my first steps into the programming world with the fundamental web technologies of CSS(Tailwind) and HTML. While learning these languages, I discovered how to shape the appearance and structure of websites. Later on, I delved into C++ and C languages to create more complex programs and algorithms. These experiences allowed me to explore the power and limitless potential of software.

Currently, I am studying at Harran University, pursuing a degree in computer engineering. Throughout my university education, my interest in programming has deepened, and I have particularly focused on the Kotlin language. Kotlin has captivated me with its flexibility and broad range of applications. Understanding object-oriented programming and developing applications using Kotlin's powerful libraries excites me.

Skills: Java / C / C++/ Kotlin
